# The Sovereign Handbook: Strategic Intent 🦉⚓

> "A tool is used; a platform is commanded."

## Introduction
This handbook is for the **Future Guardian** of the Sovereign SDLC Platform. It explains the *Why* behind the *What*.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Architecture as Law**: We do not "fix" bugs; we enforce architectural constraints. If code violates the structure, it is the code that is wrong, not the structure.
2.  **Human at the Helm**: The AI is faster, but the Human is liable. Never allow an agent to bypass the `sign_off.ts` protocol for critical actions.
3.  **Digital Saneamiento**: Small, clean, and purposeful code is superior to large, complex "value-adding" features that accumulate maintenance debt.

## Managing the Agents
- **The Governor**: He is your shield. Respect his "BLOCK" results; they are usually signs of missing specs or signatures.
- **The SRE**: He is your immune system. If he reverts, do not fight him. Fix the root cause of the smell.
- **The Chief of Staff**: He is your strategist. Review the WBS periodically to ensure you aren't building a "tower of babel".

## Succession
Keep your private key safe. If you hand over the command, pass this handbook first.
